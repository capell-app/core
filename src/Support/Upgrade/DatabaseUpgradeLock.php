/**
 * Mutual exclusion for upgrades, enforced by the database rather than the cache.
 *
 * An upgrade runs migrations. Two of them at once against one database races the
 * `migrations` table and can half-apply a schema change, so this has to be a real
 * guarantee. Cache::lock is only as global as the configured store: on the `file`
 * or `array` driver, or per-node Redis, every node believes it holds the lock.
 *
 * A unique index cannot be fooled by cache topology, so the lock lives there. The
 * row carries its own expiry because a hard-killed process never gets to release
 * it, and an upgrade lock stranded forever is its own kind of outage.
 *
 * The lock table is itself created by a migration, so an installation upgrading
 * from before it existed has nowhere to put the row. In that case this falls back
 * to the cache lock, which is exactly the previous behaviour — no worse than
 * before, and it upgrades itself once the migration has run.
